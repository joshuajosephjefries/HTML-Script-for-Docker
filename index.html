                    Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping,
                    and running applications. Docker enables you to separate
                    your applications from your infrastructure so you can
                    deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage
                    your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your
                    applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies
                    for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly,
                    you can significantly reduce the delay between writing
                    code and running it in production.
