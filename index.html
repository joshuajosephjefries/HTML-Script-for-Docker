                    Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping,
                    and running applications. Docker enables you to separate
                    your applications from your infrastructure so you can
                    deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage
                    your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your
                    applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies
                    for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly,
                    you can significantly reduce the delay between writing
                    code and running it in production.

                  Main Command:  docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND

                  docker pull "image name"/ docker image pull "image name" -> Pull images from docker hub

                  docker images/ docker image ls -> Check the list of pulled images

                  docker rmi "image name" -> Remove the image from the list

                  docker rmi -f "image_ID" -> Force delete an image even when it is running

                  docker image history "image name" ->  Show image history

                  docker run "image name" -> create a container

                  docker rm "container ID/name" -> Remove a container

                  docker run -it "imagename" "controller shell" -> To run in bin/bash or bin/sh
                  (default is bin/sh)

                  Bin/sh and Bin/bash

                  "bash and sh are two different shells. Basically bash is sh, with more features and better syntax.
                  Most commands work the same, but they are different."

                  #!bin/sh or bin/bash -> Shebang

                  bin/bash is most commonly used -> more features
                  bin/sh is short form or symbolic to bin/bash -> less features

                  docker login -> logs into docker

                  docker logoff -> logs off docker

                  exit / Ctrl pq -> exits the container

                  docker exec -it "container ID/name" -> To get into the container

                  docker images -> docker run -> docker start -> docker exec -it "container name"

                  docker rename "old_cname" "new_cname" -> To change the name of the container

                  docker container rename "container_id" "new_name" -> To change the name of container

                  docker run --name "name" "image ID" -> To name a container while creating

                  docker image prune -> Remove all dangling images

                  docker ps -a "or" docker container ls -> Used to check the containers

                  docker ps -> used to check only the active containers

                  docker container stats "c_ID" -> shows the statistics of the container

                  docker container pause "c_ID" -> pauses the docker container

                  docker container unpause "c_ID" -> unpauses the docker container

                  Local tag:

                  docker image tag "source_image_name" "new_name" -> creates a copy of the existing image on local host

                  Remote tag:

                  docker image tag "source image name" "new_name" -> creates a copy of the existing image on local host or on docker hub

                  Remote tag always requires a login

                  docker push "image name: tag" -> push the image to docker hub

                  docker image inspect "image_ID" -> image inspection

                  docker login -u "username" -p "password" -> one line command, unsecure
